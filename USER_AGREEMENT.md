### User Agreement for Remote Blueprint Service

**Version:** 1.2
**Last Updated:** December 17, 2025

#### 0. Priority & Compliance
**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** This service operates based on the game *RimWorld*. **The End User License Agreement (EULA) and related content policies of Ludeon Studios hold the highest priority.**
*   In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and Ludeon Studios' official policies (such as regulations regarding the non-commercialization of mods), Ludeon Studios' policies shall prevail.
*   This service is an unofficial feature provided by a third-party mod author and is not reviewed, approved, or associated with Ludeon Studios.

#### 1. Acceptance of Agreement
Welcome to the "Remote Blueprint Sharing" feature provided by this mod. This service aims to provide players with a platform to store, share, and download game layouts online.
**By enabling the remote features of this mod (including uploading, downloading, voting), you acknowledge that you fully understand and agree to all terms of this Agreement.** If you do not agree to any of the following terms, please do not use the remote features. This will not affect your ability to use the local offline features of the mod.

#### 2. Authentication & Privacy Security
To identify your uploads and prevent malicious voting manipulation, this service requires basic authentication:
*   **Encrypted Credentials:** The system generates a unique **Obfuscated Credential** based on your **Steam ID** using an **Encryption Algorithm (AES)**.
*   **Decryption Notice:** The primary purpose of this process is to prevent ordinary users from directly viewing your Steam ID. However, in cases of technical necessity (e.g., data migration) or serious violations (e.g., illegal content), **the administrator reserves the right to decrypt the credential back to the original Steam ID** for investigation purposes. Please be aware that in a client-side environment, it is technically impossible to guarantee that the credential cannot be reverse-engineered by third parties.
*   **Acknowledgment:** While we encrypt your credentials, please be aware that a Steam ID is inherently public information.
*   **Usage Limits:** This key is used solely to verify the uploader's identity, record voting data (likes/dislikes), and manage the blueprints you upload.
*   **Privacy Commitment:** We will not publicly associate your IP address with your game identity. IP addresses are recorded and used solely for maintaining server security (e.g., defending against DDoS attacks or banning abusive users).

#### 3. Content Licensing & CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
This service advocates free sharing with respect for the author. Regarding the blueprint content you upload:
*   **Licensing:** You agree that once you upload a blueprint to this server, you voluntarily license the content under the **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International)** license.
    *   This means any player in the community (including the service provider) is free to Share (copy and redistribute) and Adapt (remix, transform, and build upon) your blueprints.
    *   **Non-Commercial:** Users **must not** use your blueprints for commercial purposes.
    *   **ShareAlike:** If others remix, transform, or build upon your blueprint, they must distribute their contributions under the same license as the original.
    *   **Attribution:** Users must give appropriate **credit** (i.e., retaining your name as the original author) when using or distributing your blueprint.
*   **Operational License:** You grant the mod author a perpetual right to store, organize, and display your uploaded content on the server, and to perform technical transcoding or compression as necessary to adapt to the service.
*   **Copyright Declaration:** The layout design of the blueprint belongs to the uploader. In the event of a copyright dispute, you shall bear the responsibility alone; the mod author acts solely as a service platform provider and assumes no joint liability.

#### 4. Community Standards & Access Restrictions
To maintain a healthy community environment, the server will **reject your request (Access Denied)** if the system detects, or if reports verify, the following violations:
1.  **Prohibited Content:** Uploading content that violates laws and regulations, or contains pornography, gore, terror, politically sensitive material, or content likely to cause extreme discomfort to others.
2.  **Malicious Attacks:** Uploading corrupted data containing malicious code designed to crash others' games (e.g., "Zip bombs").
3.  **Resource Abuse:** Malicious spamming, using scripts for high-frequency requests, or other behaviors that exhaust server resources.
4.  **Rights Appeals:** If you discover that a blueprint uploaded by another user infringes upon your original copyright, please contact the author with evidence for negotiation and resolution.
**Note:** "Access Denied" means you will be unable to connect to the remote blueprint library for uploading or downloading. If you believe this is a system error, you may appeal by contacting the author via the mod release page or Discord.

#### 5. Technical Limitations & Liability Disclaimer
*RimWorld* is a highly moddable game, and blueprint usability is limited by the player's mod environment:
*   **Upload Limit:** The maximum size for a single blueprint file is **5MB**. Blueprints exceeding this size cannot be uploaded; please try to simplify or split them.
*   **Dependency Warning:** When uploading blueprints, please ensure the file contains valid game data. If the blueprint contains items from other mods, please note this in the description.
*   **Corrupt Save Disclaimer:** This service assumes no responsibility for fixing **"red text" errors, game crashes, or save file corruption** caused by missing prerequisite mods, game version mismatches, or blueprint data conflicts. **It is recommended to backup your save file before downloading complex blueprints.**
You assume all risks associated with data loss, abnormal game operation, or hardware damage resulting from the use of this service.

#### 6. Service Changes & Termination
This service is developed and maintained by the mod author individually and operates on a **non-profit and donation-supported** basis:
*   **Termination:** Due to financial pressure, force majeure, or changes in development plans, the author reserves the right to **suspend maintenance or permanently close the server** without prior notice.
*   **Data Security:** The author does not guarantee the permanent preservation of cloud data. Players are advised to keep local backups of important blueprints.
*   **Right to Deletion:** Users have the right to contact the administrator via the Discord discussion group or QQ to request the deletion of all their uploaded data.

#### 7. Legal Governing & Dispute Resolution
*   **Applicable Law:** The validity, interpretation, and dispute resolution of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws and regulations of **the location of the server and the mod author**, to the extent permitted by law.
*   **Severability:** If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, it shall not affect the validity of the other provisions.

#### 8. Amendments & Notifications
To adapt to service development, technical upgrades, or changes in laws and regulations, the author reserves the right to modify this Agreement when necessary.
*   **Update Notification:** When significant changes occur, we will provide prominent notice in the mod update logs, Steam Workshop page, or via in-game pop-ups.
*   **Re-confirmation:** For changes involving core user rights (such as privacy policy adjustments or changes in licensing scope), the system may require you to click **"Agree" again** before continuing to use the remote service.
*   **Default Acceptance:** If you continue to use the remote features of this service after the release of an agreement update, it is deemed that you have read and accepted the modified agreement. If you do not agree to the changes, please stop using the remote features immediately.

#### 9. Sponsorship & Support
The operation of this server (bandwidth, database storage) may requires continuous financial investment.
*   **Completely Free:** This service strictly follows the *RimWorld* EULA policy. All core features (upload, download, search) are **permanently free** for all players.
*   **About Sponsorship:** If you find this feature helpful, **you are welcome to sponsor me via [Patreon/Ko-fi/etc.]**. Your support will go directly towards paying server bills and developing future features. Please note that this is entirely a **voluntary donation** and does not involve any paywalls or feature unlocking.
